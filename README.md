## Source Code and Research Contributions from Bachelor Thesis on Segmentation of astrographic maps images from the project CarteDuCiel

This repository hosts the complete source code developed as part of my bachelor thesis, 
encapsulating the core implementation and methodologies presented in the research, 
with a scientific paper based on this work to be published soon.

This topic addresses ideas and concepts of the project called Carte du Ciel (French for “Map of the Sky”), 
using them as the groundwork for its exploration.
Carte Du Ciel is the first major international scientific project to photographically record the entire sky, 
not to reproduce the aspect of the stars, but to map and determine their positions.
The outcome was preserved as photographic plates and their corresponding paper copies, known as astrographic maps.

In this repository, you will find procedures, rules and algorithms for segmentation and automatic data extraction
of the triple stars images or the so called asterisms, contained in these astrographic maps. 

The proposed approaches covers two main sub-tasks: the segmentation and data extraction of the réseau (i.e., grid)
and the segmentation and data extraction of the triple stars images from the sub-square regions found within the réseau, the so-called asterisms, from the astrographic map images.
